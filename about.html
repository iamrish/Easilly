					<h2>About Project : Easilly</h2>
					<p>Healthcare is one of the primary focus of the ambitious Smart Cities project of the Government of India. So, our project focuses on improving the way healthcare services are
                    delivered to a common man.<br/>
                    For this we have created a website which simply links medical history of individuals with their Aadhaar number. This linked medical history gets stored in a database, which is remotely accessible as and when required. As nowadays almost everyone has an aadhaar number this could come quite handy during many situations.<br/>
                        <ul>
                            <li>First and most important use of this would be saving the persons life during emergency situations. Suppose the person meets an accident and is badly injured. During this time our website would be helpful. As soon as the person is taken in ambulance his or her biometrics could be scanned and the medical history of that person would be accessible. This would enable the nursing staff in ambulance to give him first aid as all the allergies and previous diseases/disorders would be known to then then and there. Also this history would also be sent to the hospital where the person is being taken. There doctors would get access to personâ€™s medical history and would prepare the treatment beforehand during transit time only and could also arrange for blood in advance as his blood group and all such information would be known.</li><br/>
            
                            <li>Another thing is that during certain situations a certain treatment which is required might not be available in the hospital where is patient is being taken due to previous medical reasons. During such cases the person could be redirected to another hospital so time would be saved. As we know during emergencies time is most important factor in determining  if the patient could be saved or not. This becomes another use of it.</li><br/>
                            <li>Third use would be that during certain situations the identity of person cannot be determined after accident. So,as his identity would already be determined by Aadhaar, the hospitals could contact his relatives and a formal police complaint could also be registered for medico-legal cases.</li><br/>
                            <li>Fourth use could be research.As we would have a huge medical databse researchers could use this information either keeping the person anonymous or by taking their permission for various demographic researches and medicinal researches. This could again prove benificial for mankind.  </li><br/>
                        </ul>
                    
                    All this could prove life saving in some very serious cases. Also as this information can be kept encrypted there is very less chance of tampering with medical information so Medico-legal cases could also handled very well using this information.
